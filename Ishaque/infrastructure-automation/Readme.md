#### Building End-to-End Infrastructure Automation with Terraform in AWS



- Create reusable Terraform modules for infrastructure components (EC2 instances, VPCs, EKS, S3 Buckets) and store state in AWS S3 for collaboration.

- Build a CI/CD pipeline in AWS CodePipeline / Jenkins to automate infrastructure deployment, triggering Terraform plan/apply on Git push, and integrating AWS Secrets Manager for secret management.

- Enable automated testing using Terratest or InSpec to validate Terraform code and add post-deployment validation steps in the pipeline.

- Integrate code quality tools (Checkov or TFLint) for scanning Terraform code and implement static analysis in the CI/CD pipeline.

- Implement versioning and rollback mechanisms using Terraform Cloud or AWS CodeArtifact, including state locking to prevent concurrent modifications.
